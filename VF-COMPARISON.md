# Sahel Font: Variable Font vs Static Fonts Comparison

This document compares the glyph coverage and character support between the Variable Font (VF) and the static font files.

## Summary

| Metric | Variable Font | Static Fonts (Combined) |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Glyphs** | 329 | 552 |
| **Mapped Characters** | 288 | 545 |
| **Number of Tables** | 18 | - |
| **Number of Weights** | Continuous (300-900) | 5 discrete weights |

## Key Findings

### ✅ Coverage Analysis

- **100% of VF glyphs are present in static fonts** - All glyphs in the variable font are available in the static versions
- **100% of VF characters are present in static fonts** - All characters supported by the variable font are also supported by static versions
- **No VF-exclusive glyphs or characters** - The variable font does not contain any glyphs or characters that aren't in the static fonts

### ⚠️ Differences

The static fonts contain **223 additional glyphs** (40.4% more) and **257 additional characters** (47.1% more) that are not present in the variable font.

This is expected behavior and indicates that:
1. The variable font is a **subset** of the static fonts
2. The variable font was optimized to include only essential glyphs
3. Static fonts maintain full backward compatibility with additional glyphs for extended language support

## Detailed Comparison

### Glyph Count by Weight

All static font weights have identical glyph coverage:

| Weight | Glyphs | Mapped Characters | VF Coverage |
|--------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Light (300)** | 552 | 545 | 100% |
| **Regular (400)** | 552 | 545 | 100% |
| **SemiBold (600)** | 552 | 545 | 100% |
| **Bold (700)** | 552 | 545 | 100% |
| **Black (900)** | 552 | 545 | 100% |

### Sample of Glyphs in Static Fonts Only

The static fonts include additional glyphs such as:
- Latin letters: `H`, `K`, `M`, `X`, `o`, `q`
- Numbers: `two`, `five`
- Punctuation: `braceright`, `bullet`, `quoteleft`
- Ligatures: `uniFB01` (fi ligature)
- Special symbols: `yen`, `logicalnot`, `lozenge`, `ordmasculine`
- Arabic reference glyphs: `uniFB7B.ref1`, `uniFB93.ref1`

## Technical Details

### Variable Font Properties

- **Format**: TrueType with OpenType variations
- **Variation Axes**: Weight (wght) from 300 to 900
- **Tables**: 18 OpenType tables including `fvar` (font variations)
- **Optimized for**: Web usage and variable weight rendering

### Static Fonts Properties

- **Format**: Standard TrueType
- **Weights**: 5 discrete weights (Light, Regular, SemiBold, Bold, Black)
- **Optimized for**: Full character coverage and backward compatibility

## Recommendations

### When to Use Variable Font (VF)

✅ **Use VF when:**
- You need variable weight control (any weight between 300-900)
- File size optimization is important (single file vs 5 files)
- You're targeting modern browsers with variable font support
- You only need core Persian/Farsi character support

### When to Use Static Fonts

✅ **Use Static Fonts when:**
- You need maximum character coverage
- You need specific discrete weights
- You're supporting older systems or browsers
- You need additional glyphs and ligatures

## Conclusions

1. **The variable font is a proper subset** - All VF glyphs exist in static fonts (100% coverage)
2. **Static fonts provide extended coverage** - 223 additional glyphs for broader language support
3. **No data loss in VF** - Users of the variable font get all essential glyphs
4. **Both versions are production-ready** - Each serves different use cases effectively

The differences are **intentional and appropriate** for their respective use cases:
- VF focuses on **core functionality** with **variable weight**
- Static fonts provide **comprehensive coverage** with **fixed weights**
